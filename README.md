# Annual Firearms Manufacturers And Export Report

All federally licensed manufacturers of firearms and destructive devices (Federal Firearms License types 07 and 10) are required to submit a production report of manufacturing and export activity to ATF by April 1 of each year. The information must be reported using the Annual Firearms Manufacturing and Exportation Report Under 18 U.S.C. Chapter 44, Firearms (ATF Form 5300.11). The report covers activity for the calendar year ended the previous December 31. For example, calendar year 2018 data was due to ATF by April 1, 2019.

ATF compiles the submitted data and releases it here each January, with a one year delay to comply with the Trade Secrets Act. For example, data released in January 2019 was for calendar year 2018. The January 2014 data release covers calendar year 2012 activity. In response to requests from the industry, ATF released interim AFMER data for the first time in July 2010. This release included aggregate data only and did not identify any specific industry member (to comply with the Trade Secrets Act).

Frequently asked questions related to AFMER are available in our Questions and Answers section. Any questions not covered there should be directed to the Federal Firearms Licensing Center
